Newly added films will be located at the bottom of the table.

### Format Switching:
You can toggle the format in the dropdown located in the top right in JSON, XML and Text formats.
This allows you to perform the CRUD and search operations in the above formats.

### Search:
You can also perform search operations on the database by using the search box (located in the table header) by:
- Title
- Year
- ID
- All Fields

You can click the clear/`X` button to clear your input and reset the table state.
